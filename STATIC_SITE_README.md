# How to Use This Static GitHub Page

1. Place your images in the `docs/` folder and name them exactly as referenced in the HTML:
   - `image1.png` ← ![image1](image1)
   - `image2.png` ← ![image2](image2)
   - `image3.png` ← ![image3](image3)

2. Commit the files:
   - `docs/index.html`
   - `docs/style.css`
   - Images: `docs/image1.png`, `docs/image2.png`, `docs/image3.png`

3. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings:
   - Go to the "Settings" tab > "Pages"
   - Set the source branch to your default branch (e.g., `main`) and the folder to `/docs`
   - Save and wait for your site to be published

4. Visit your new site at:
